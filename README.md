Hey there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25">

I'm Mukesh Singh, a Full Stack Developer from India, currently at NIUM India Pvt. Ltd. I specialize in building robust, scalable applications with a strong focus on clean architecture, elegant interfaces, and developer-first tooling. My passion for technology is matched by a relentless drive to learn and push boundaries‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs deep-diving into Rust, mastering backend frameworks, or exploring the latest in blockchain.

### üöÄ What I Do
- **Full Stack Engineering**: Architecting and developing end-to-end solutions using TypeScript, NextJS, Rust, and Spring Boot. I enjoy building everything from admin consoles ([typesense-ui](https://github.com/BadgerBloke/typesense-ui)) to backend systems and developer utilities.
- **Authentication Systems**: Currently building [shield](https://github.com/TheShieldAuth/shield), an authentication system from scratch in Rust‚Äîfocused on security, performance, and extensibility.
- **Blockchain Enthusiast**: Actively learning and experimenting with Solana to build next-generation decentralized applications.
- **Open Source Leadership**: Contributor and maintainer across numerous open-source repositories. I believe in the power of community and knowledge sharing.

### üèÜ Highlights
- **1,300+ contributions in the last year** across 40+ repositories
- **Pinned Projects**:
  - [TheShieldAuth/shield](https://github.com/TheShieldAuth/shield): Rust-based authentication system (built from scratch)
  - [typesense-ui](https://github.com/BadgerBloke/typesense-ui): NextJS admin console for Typesense
