Hi, I'm [Mukesh Singh](https://www.MukeshSingh.in/), Chartered Accountancy final year student and a passionate self-taught Full Stack web developer and a freelance software engineer from India. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
